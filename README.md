# Data Mining and Data Processing Project

This is a university project about data mining and data processing that implements K-NN classifiers, PCA, and SVD in a Jupyter Notebook. The project aims to explore the use of these techniques for analyzing and processing large datasets, and to evaluate their effectiveness in solving real-world problems using the sklearn digits dataset.

## Project Overview

The project consists of a Jupyter Notebook that implements K-NN classifiers, PCA, and SVD for analyzing and processing datasets. The notebook is divided into several sections, each of which explores a different aspect of the techniques and their applications. Some of the topics covered in the notebook include:

- Data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Feature extraction and selection.
- Dimensionality reduction using PCA and SVD.
- Classification using K-NN classifiers.

The notebook includes code examples, visualizations, and explanations of the techniques used, as well as sample datasets for testing and evaluation.
